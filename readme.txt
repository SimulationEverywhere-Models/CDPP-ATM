Please Note that every Atomic Model Folder contains Makefile, register.cpp and files needed to run the 
that atomic model only.

To run any of the atomic models, source files need to be copied and compiled with included
Makefile.


The final "Makefile" which compiles the all ATM model components is located under
 "All nedded file for ATM".

Final copy of "Register.cpp" which contains all components is also in "All nedded file for ATM".


Other copies of Makefile in atomic models folders are incremental copy in which only
subset of models has been specified to be compiled.


Other copies of register.cpp in atomic models folders are incremental copy in which only
subset of models has been registered.


To RUN ATM MODEL:-
---------------------

Copy all files from "All nedded file for ATM" into cygwin home directory and "make" the files.

After compilation, run "DEMOATM.BAT" to execute ATM model.
